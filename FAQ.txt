Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Q: Can I export the graph?

A: This is a limitation of the canvas technology. There's a hook in
the canvas object for getting an image out, but you won't get the tick
labels. And it's not likely to be supported by IE. At this point, your
best bet is probably taking a screenshot, e.g. with PrtScn.


Q: The bars are all tiny in time mode?

A: It's not really possible to determine the bar width
automatically. So you have to set the width with the barWidth option
which it is NOT in pixels, but in the units of the x axis. For time
mode that's milliseconds so the default value of 1 makes the bars 1
millisecond wide.


Q: Can I use Flot with libraries like Mootools or Prototype?

A: Yes, and it's easy! In the API documentation and examples you
simply replace $ with jQuery. Depending on how you include jQuery, you
may have to do one more thing to prevent it from overwriting functions
from the other libraries, see the documentation in jQuery ("Using
jQuery with other libraries") for details.


Q: Flot doesn't work with [framework xyz]!

A: The problem is most likely within the framework, or your use of the
framework.

The only non-standard thing used by Flot is the canvas tag; otherwise
it is simply a series of absolute positioned divs within the
placeholder tag you put in. If this is not working, it's probably
because the framework you're using is doing something weird with the
DOM. As a last resort, you might try replotting and see if it helps.

If you find there's a specific thing we can do to Flot to help, feel
free to submit a bug report. Otherwise, you're welcome to ask for help
on the mailing list, but please don't submit a bug report to Flot -
try the framework instead.
